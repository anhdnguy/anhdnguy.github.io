I am a Master student who is major in Applied Mathematics at San Diego State University. My research interests include develping Machine Learning models for biological applications. Under the guidance of [Dr. Uduak George] (https://georgelab.sdsu.edu/), [Dr. Joy Philips] (https://sci.sdsu.edu/dpsbsc/), and [Ashley Schwartz] (https://ashleyschwartz.com/), my thesis focuses on developing a workflow to identify the function of macrophage in vaping lungs. I am also working as a Computer System Administrator at Westcliff University, where I develop integration between systems. Currently, we are building a Azure Data Warehouse to centralize data from different sources.
