I am working as an IT Specialist at [Westcliff University](https://www.westcliff.edu/), where I plan and build data systems. My interests include building data warehouse, implementing virtual desktop for staff by utilizing services on Microsoft Azure, and developing Machine Learning models to make machines think. I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/). Under the guidance of [Dr. Uduak George](https://georgelab.sdsu.edu/), [Dr. Joy Philips](https://sci.sdsu.edu/dpsbsc/), and [Ashley Schwartz](https://ashleyschwartz.com/), my thesis focuses on building a workflow to identify the immune function in vaping-associated pulmonary injury using spatial transcriptomics approach.
