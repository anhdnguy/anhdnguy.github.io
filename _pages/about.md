I am a Graduate student who is pursuing the Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at [San Diego State University](https://www.sdsu.edu/). My research interests include developing Machine Learning models for biological applications. Under the guidance of [Dr. Uduak George](https://georgelab.sdsu.edu/), [Dr. Joy Philips](https://sci.sdsu.edu/dpsbsc/), and [Ashley Schwartz](https://ashleyschwartz.com/), my thesis focuses on building a workflow to identify the function of macrophage in vaped lungs using spatial transcriptomics data. I am also working as a Computer System Administrator at [Westcliff University](https://www.westcliff.edu/), where I plan and build data systems.
